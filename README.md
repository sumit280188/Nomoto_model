# Nomoto_model

This is 1st order Nomoto model in C++. The model is used for tuning autopilot systems for ships.
The program may also serve as a template for ship models with a higher degree of freedom, e.g. 3DoF.

The model is integrated within a search-based planning library (SBPL).
This combination of the Nomoto model and SBPL is used for the creation of motion primitives with the A* algorithm for finding the optimal paths for autonomous ships. 

Cmake is used to create the build files.
